Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System an Overview


    1.Abstract : A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow onlinepayments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through afinancial institution.
    
    
    2.Transactions:We define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures. Each owner transfers the coin to the next by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner
                  and adding these to the end of the coin. A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of ownership.
    -->If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains.
    
 --->The necessity to announce all transactions publicly precludes privacy, but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in another place: by keeping public keys anonymous
 
---> This is similar to the level of information released by stock exchanges, where the time and size of individual trades, the "tape", is made public, but without telling who the parties were.
